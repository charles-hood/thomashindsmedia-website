THOMAS HINDS
Solo Acoustic Artist & Poetic Troubadour
Northern Georgia

---

Thomas Hinds, a troubadour from northern Georgia, has spent years playing an impressive mix of original songs that share the struggles of life, love, and finding oneself within these melodies all over the southeastern U.S. and beyond. The covers he chooses fit nicely with his voice and onstage demeanor, always tinged with a silvery hue and inspiring to never give up, no matter how the world around us appears.

A hard-touring artist surviving on raw talent and a heartfelt folk-rock repertoire, Thomas performs full-time across the country, averaging 70,000 miles annually. His sound has been described as "a cross between the ethereal crooning of Jeff Buckley and the down-to-earth angst of early Wilco," with a touch of Ray LaMontagne and Steve Earle in the fabric of his songs.

Thomas began writing in his early twenties but stepped away to raise a family. When his children went out on their own, he committed to performing full-time starting in 2019—and never looked back. In 2021 alone, he played nearly 150 shows and logged over 60,000 miles.

Relocating from New Mexico to North Georgia, Thomas found fertile ground for growing and solidifying his voice among some amazingly talented musicians and songwriters. His travels took him to Alabama's legendary FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, where he recorded "Where Do We Go From Here" (2023) with six musicians who helped flesh out his sound—bringing together the lilting melodies of Americana with the swampy Muscle Shoals groove.

The album reached #86 on the top 100 Americana Album charts, with three songs charting in Georgia's top ten. In 2024, Thomas performed at SXSW in Austin, Texas, further establishing his presence on the national touring circuit.

Beyond music, Thomas is also the author of "Ghost of a River" (2022), a collection that showcases his poetic sensibilities and storytelling craft.

His influences span the folk and Americana traditions—from Dylan to Anna Tivel, Jeffrey Martin to Jon Charles Dwyer—artists who share his commitment to honest, literate songwriting. Fellow artist Jeffrey Foucault noted that Thomas's work "showed a lot of growth in the songwriting."

"Music has always and will always be a shelter in the storms of life for me. I write out the melancholy so I can purge it."
