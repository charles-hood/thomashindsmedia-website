THOMAS HINDS
Solo Acoustic Artist & Poetic Troubadour

Thomas Hinds is a hard-touring troubadour from northern Georgia, surviving on raw talent and a heartfelt folk-rock repertoire. Averaging 70,000 miles annually, he brings original songs about life, love, and finding oneself to stages across the country. His sound has been described as "a cross between the ethereal crooning of Jeff Buckley and the down-to-earth angst of early Wilco." His 2023 album "Where Do We Go From Here," recorded at Alabama's legendary FAME Studios, reached #86 on the Americana Album charts.
