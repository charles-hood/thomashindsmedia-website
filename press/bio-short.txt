THOMAS HINDS
Solo Acoustic Artist & Poetic Troubadour

A hard-touring troubadour surviving on raw talent and a heartfelt folk-rock repertoire, Thomas Hinds performs full-time across the country with half a million miles under his belt over the last six years. A singer/songwriter out of northern Georgia, Thomas has been building a reputation for lyrical depth and an original voice musically. His 2023 album "Where Do We Go From Here," recorded at Alabama's legendary FAME Studios, reached #86 on the Americana Album charts. His highly anticipated follow-up, "Hotel Room Songs," drops in 2026.

Thomas is also the author of two books of poetry and prose: "Ghost of a River" (2022) and "In The Details" (2024).
